# An Analysis of kickstarter Campaigns

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help an up and coming playwriter Louise start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play fever, and is estimating a budget of $10,000. Her play came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time and now she is motivated to learn how different campaigns did compared to each other with respect to their launch dates and their funding goals. This analysis looked to determine if there was a correlation between launch dates and their funding goal. 

## Methodology 
This analysis was performed by utilizing excels pivot table/chart features, and by coding them to look at the large amount of data to draw some conclusions. For the first deliverable we looked at the relationship between launch dates and success/failed/canceled outcomes. We did this by sorting through the data and pulling the data by month. This process was fairly straight forward and did not provide too many challenges.

For the second deliverable we organized our data based on the goal range, and tallied the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects utilizing Countifs(). We then translated this data to a pivote chart to better visualize the date. This section had a few challenges when making sure all of the correct parameters were set in the Countifs() function.

##Conclusion
After conducting our analysis, we are able to give Louise some useful information. We are able to tell her that the most impacted months with the most total number of play writes are April-August, so maybe she might want to take this into consideration. We can also inform her that May and June are the Peak success months for theater. December has the least amount of successes, and October has the most failed. She may want to launch in May or June. We can also advise her that the projects with the highest success rate were those whoâ€™s goals were between 1000 to 4999, so maybe she might want to consider lowering her budget since there is nothing to suggest more money yields a higher success rate
